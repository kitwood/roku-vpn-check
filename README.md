# Roku VPN Checker Channel

This is a simple Roku utility channel that displays the output from an IP-based geolocation service on screen. Use this to sanity check whether your VPN is currently working without a secondary device.

The geolocation is done using [ipgeolocation.io](https://ipgeolocation.io/).

The screen also displays the User Country Code, Country Code, and Locale from the [roDeviceInfo](https://developer.roku.com/docs/references/brightscript/components/rodeviceinfo.md_) object.
